## Overview

Comedy Matchmaker is an app where comedians can connect with other comedians in their city and book shows. One comedian creates a show with a specified amount of vacant slots, and other comedians can submit, either as an individual or as part of as improv team they've joined on the site, to those vacant slots. The creator then selects their lineup based on the submissions.
